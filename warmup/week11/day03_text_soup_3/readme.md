# Text Soup 3: The Final Chapter

Make a few modifications to the code from [Text Soup 2](https://github.com/rashidabengali/sei33-homework/tree/master/warmup/week07/day05_text_soup_2) (make a copy, don't edit the version in the homework repo!), to cause the random words to be sourced dynamically via AJAX from Wikipedia, instead of from a hidden DIV already present in the HTML.

Your code should allow the user to specify a Wikipedia page name via a querystring field in the URL, such as `index.html?page=Sherlock+Holmes`, whose contents will then be loaded via the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).

([SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2381642/returning-data-from-wikipedia-using-ajax) is your friend, and so is [Google](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=javascript+get+querystring+key+value).)
