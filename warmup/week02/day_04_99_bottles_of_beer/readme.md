# 99 bottles of beer
"99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional reverse counting song.

It is popular to sing on long trips, as it is repetitive and easy to memorise but -- it can take a long time to sing.

Lets try and make it run a little quicker using code:

The song's lyrics are as follows:

``` 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall... ```

The same verse is repeated, each time with one bottle fewer, until there are none left.

Bear in mind, not all verses are the same:

The verse for 1 bottle is as follows:

``` 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer. Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall. ```

The verse for 0 bottles is as follows:

``` No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall. ```

### Bonus:

- Count through any number of bottles.

- Be able to count between a range of numbers (ie, 20 to 10).
