## Text Soup: Trump Edition

Today is a very special day. Spectacular even. My people, you are about to start what is objectively the worlds best warmup. Truly a special moment. Best of the best. This is not fake news. We are going to make warmups great again!

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript + jQuery, create a web page which prints a random word from a large sample of text, in a random position on the page, every 100 milliseconds.

Today we will be using a random sample of tweets from America's greatest President to ever be in power, Mr. Donald J Trump better known on Twitter as @realDonaldTrump.

**Hints:**
- Copy all of the text from the trump_tweets.txt file and paste the text into a hidden <div> element in your HTML file, and use jQuery to get the contents of the div.
- For reference you can find more presidential content at [Trump Twitter Archive]("http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/")

**Bonus:**
- Fade the text in to make it appear, and then fade it out to disappear, to stop the page getting too dense with quality presidential twitter content.
- Try random colours, random font sizes, rotation, whatever floats your boat.
