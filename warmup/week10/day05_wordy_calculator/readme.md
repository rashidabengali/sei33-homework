# Wordy Calculator
Write Ruby code that takes word problems in the following formats:

```
What is 5 plus 13?

What is 7 minus 5?

What is -6 multiplied by 4?

What is 25 divided by -5?
```

and returns the answer as an integer.

You should define a Calculator class which uses the constructor function (initialize) to set the question, and an answer method to return the answer.

Use a regular expression to parse the question.

### HINT: You will probably want to use Ruby's match method, and in particular a capture group which uses parentheses in the regex, and returns a MatchData array.
