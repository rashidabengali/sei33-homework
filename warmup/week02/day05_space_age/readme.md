# Space Age Warmup
Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on the following planets:

- Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days
- Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
- Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
- Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
- Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
- Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
- Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
- Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say:

``You are 31.68808781402895 Earth-years old``
``You are 131.56953287725742 Mercury-years old``
``You are 51.50882468824545 Venus-years old``
``You are 16.848054878116695 Mars-years old``
``You are 2.6712565327315225 Jupiter-years old``
``You are 1.0760876124018737 Saturn-years old``
``You are 0.37716350140100413 Uranus-years old``
``You are 0.1922922142624317 Neptune-years old``

There are 31557600 seconds in an Earth year.

### Bonus:
Have the option of either returning the ages on all planets, or any of the above planets individually.
