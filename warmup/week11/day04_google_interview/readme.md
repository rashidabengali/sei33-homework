# Google Interview Question
This question was asked in an interview at Google, for a Junior Engineer role.

Given an unordered array of integers and a value named sum, `return true` if any two items can be added and equal the value of sum. Otherwise, `return false`.

So, if we were given the array ``[3, 5, 1, 4]`` and the value `9`, our function should `return true`, because `4 + 5 = 9`.
